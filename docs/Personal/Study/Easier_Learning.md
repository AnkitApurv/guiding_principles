1. Retrieve & recall during studying
2. Spaced repetition (Leave time from session to session; Longer spaces = longer retention time)
3. Switch up topics when studying (Better retention: Maths - Working on different geometric figures; Art: Learning different artists' works)
4. Elaborative Interrogation (Ask WHY & HOW types of questions when learning - This integrates current knowledge with new material)
5. You need to explain material to yourself as you're going through it to make sure that you fully understand it (Feynman technique ) 
6. you need to understand the context of the material you're learning ( for ex :where it can be used )
