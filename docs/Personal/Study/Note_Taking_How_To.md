# Note Taking How-To

## Core Principles of Taking Notes

- Write all the time.
- Everything is knowledge.
- Notes are irreducible complete thoughts.
- Knowledge is interconnected.

## How should notes be written

Organize via Zettelkasten system.

- Knowledge graphs will automatically form out of references which helps correlate complex concepts.
- All notes should be concentrated in very few, minimal/one location/folder.
  - Example:
    - One notes folder for all knowledge base
    - Another for all daily work/family/friends/personal stuff/responsibilities.
- Broad sub-sections should be formed. This is to ensure that:
  - The sub-section, though hirarchical,
  - Shouldn't be too specific and
  - Shouldn't have too many levels in the hierarchy.
- Should be written in a very long-lasting, rugged storage media which are easy to carry around.
  - Maybe not on paper due to weight, space and ruggedness concerns.
  - Not on CD/DVD/traditional HDD which could be damaged by sunlight/magnetic fields/external shocks.
  - A USB flash drive or MicroSD card inside SD card adapter is more suitable.
- Should be written using simplest of freely and openly available tools and medium.
  - Not using MS Office formats which we may lose access to due to any reason.
  - Not in gel pen in which the written contents get smudged if the paper gets enough moisture.
  - A simple text editor or programmers' text editor is ideal.
    - Example:
      - Simple text editor: Notepad, NeoVim
      - Programmers' text editor: VSCodium
  - For sake of organizing such text notes, (writing headings, links, inserting tables, images etc) simple and open markup languages can be adopted,
    - Which can be interpreted even in plain text even if the markup languages' viewers aren't available.
    - Example: Common Markdown
- Checkpoint versioning and backup and sync can and ideally should be implemented using Distributed Version Control System like Git.
  - Basically turning the notes folder into a git repository.

## Types of notes and their organization

### Fleeting Notes

- Can be ideas/concepts/thoughts that, we encounter spontaneously and wish to preserve for a revisit after a while.
- Example: Sticky notes containing summarized points while reading a book.
  - Quickly transcribing fleeting notes and
  - Then revisiting the pile of these fleeting notes on a periodic basis
  - To turn it into something more concrete and permanent:
    - Either another type of note,
    - Or an event notification etc,
    - Whatever is more suitable.
- How it's Organized:
  - It's not really organized given it's spur-of-the moment, quick nature.
  - However it can be written as a list of summarized points, should concern one topic.
  - Title (highlights any common association within the note's contents).
  - List of points which:
    - Should be unordered,
    - But can be hirarchical (but not too hirarchical).

### Summary Notes

- Something between fleeting notes and detailed notes.
- Covers all the vital points of a topic in quick summary.
- Can at as a quick reference for revision, should be minimalist.
- How it's Organized:
  - Title
  - Summary - all important points in brief.
  - References
    - Bibliography - list of sources that were consulted overall and are vital to the note's subject.

### Permanent, Detailed Notes

- Is a reliable library regardless of the availability of external references/resources.
  - Detailed notes with good quality references, proper names, update log/history.
  - Each such note should be one complete idea.
- How it's Organized:
  - Title (and 1-2 line intro if subject is large/complex)
  - Summary - all important points in brief
  - Details - complete information with specific citations where needed
  - References
    - Citations - references to other notes pointing towards specific bits of information within the current notes.
    - Bibliography - list of sources that were consulted overall and are vital to the note's subject.
